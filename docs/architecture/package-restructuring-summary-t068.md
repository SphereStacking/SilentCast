# Package Restructuring Summary - T068

## Overview
This document summarizes the package restructuring completed for T068 (パッケージ構造とインターフェースの整理).

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Duplicate Shell Implementation
- **Deleted**: `/app/internal/action/shell.go` and platform-specific shell files
- **Kept**: `/app/internal/action/shell/` subdirectory with proper package structure
- **Result**: Eliminated code duplication and confusion

### 2. Restructured Action Package
Created clear subdirectories for different action types:

```
/app/internal/action/
├── interface.go          # Core Executor interface
├── executor.go           # Manager implementation
├── app/                  # Application launcher actions
│   ├── executor.go
│   ├── launcher.go
│   └── launcher_*.go    # Platform-specific implementations
├── script/               # Script execution actions
│   └── executor.go
├── url/                  # URL opening actions
│   └── executor.go
└── shell/                # Shell execution utilities
    ├── shell.go
    └── shell_*.go        # Platform-specific implementations
```

### 3. Resolved Circular Dependencies
- Moved `elevated` package from `/app/internal/action/elevated/` to `/app/internal/elevated/`
- Added local `Executor` interface definition in elevated package
- This broke the circular dependency between action and elevated packages

### 4. Updated Package Names
All files were updated to use correct package declarations:
- Files in `/app/internal/action/app/` use `package app`
- Files in `/app/internal/action/script/` use `package script`
- Files in `/app/internal/action/url/` use `package url`
- Files in `/app/internal/action/shell/` use `package shell`

### 5. Fixed Import Paths
Updated all imports throughout the codebase to reference the new package structure:
- `action.NewAppExecutor` → `app.NewAppExecutor`
- `action.NewScriptExecutor` → `script.NewScriptExecutor`
- `action.NewURLExecutor` → `url.NewURLExecutor`

## Benefits

1. **Clearer Organization**: Each action type is now in its own package with clear responsibilities
2. **No Circular Dependencies**: The dependency graph is now acyclic
3. **Better Encapsulation**: Internal implementation details are better hidden
4. **Easier Navigation**: Developers can easily find code for specific action types
5. **Reduced Confusion**: No more duplicate files or conflicting implementations

## Testing
- All tests have been updated to use the new package structure
- Build succeeds with no compilation errors
- Test suite passes (with minor test expectation updates)

## Next Steps
- Continue with T069: Performance optimization and resource management
- Continue with T070: Comprehensive documentation update
