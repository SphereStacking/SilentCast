  ## Problem Statement
  Users need to manually check for new versions of SilentCast, which leads to outdated installations
  and missed bug fixes or new features. An automated update checker would keep users informed
  about available updates.
  
  ## Proposed Solution
  Implement an auto-update checker that periodically checks the GitHub releases API for new versions.
  The checker should be configurable (frequency, enable/disable) and respect user preferences.
  
  ## Implementation Details
  - Integrate with GitHub releases API to check for new versions
  - Add configurable update check intervals (daily, weekly, disabled)
  - Implement version comparison logic to detect newer releases
  - Add update check on application startup (optional)
  - Cache update check results to avoid excessive API calls
  - Handle network failures gracefully
  
tasks:
  - [ ] Design update checker interface and configuration
  - [ ] Implement GitHub releases API integration
  - [ ] Add version comparison logic
  - [ ] Create configurable update check scheduling
  - [ ] Add startup update check option
  - [ ] Implement result caching mechanism
  - [ ] Handle network errors and rate limiting
  - [ ] Write unit tests for update checker
  - [ ] Add integration tests with mock API responses
  - [ ] Update configuration documentation

acceptance_criteria:
  - Update checker queries GitHub releases API correctly
  - Version comparison accurately detects newer releases
  - Update checks respect configured intervals
  - Network failures don't crash the application
  - Configuration options work as expected
  - All tests pass
  - Documentation includes update checker configuration
