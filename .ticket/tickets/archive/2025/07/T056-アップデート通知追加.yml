  ## Problem Statement
  When updates are available, users need to be notified in a user-friendly way that doesn't
  interrupt their workflow. The notification system should provide clear information about
  available updates and options to act on them.
  
  ## Proposed Solution
  Implement a multi-channel notification system that can inform users about available updates
  through system notifications, tray notifications, and optional CLI output. Users should be
  able to configure notification preferences and frequency.
  
  ## Implementation Details
  - Integrate with existing notification system (internal/notify/)
  - Add system tray update notifications with actions
  - Show desktop notifications for new releases
  - Add CLI command to check and display update status
  - Include release notes and changelog information in notifications
  - Allow users to configure notification preferences (frequency, channels)
  - Support notification actions (update now, remind later, dismiss)
