  ## Problem Statement
  Linux users need a way to automatically start SilentCast at boot and manage it as a system service.
  Currently, users must manually start the application each time they boot their system.
  
  ## Proposed Solution
  Implement Linux service management that supports both systemd services and XDG autostart.
  This will provide flexible deployment options for different Linux distributions and user preferences.
  
  ## Implementation Details
  - Add systemd service file generation and installation
  - Implement XDG autostart .desktop file creation
  - Add CLI commands for service management (install, uninstall, start, stop, status)
  - Handle user vs system-wide installation options
  - Ensure proper permission handling for service operations
  
tasks:
  - [ ] Design service management interface
  - [ ] Implement systemd service file generation
  - [ ] Add XDG autostart .desktop file creation
  - [ ] Create CLI commands for service management
  - [ ] Add permission handling for service operations
  - [ ] Write unit tests for service management
  - [ ] Add integration tests
  - [ ] Update documentation with service setup instructions

acceptance_criteria:
  - Users can install SilentCast as a systemd service
  - Users can enable XDG autostart functionality
  - CLI commands work for service management operations
  - Service starts automatically at boot
  - All tests pass
  - Documentation includes service setup instructions
