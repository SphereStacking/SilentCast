labels: [ci-cd, maintenance]

description: |
  The benchmark workflow has been causing persistent issues across different platforms:
  - Windows: Path resolution problems ("no Go files" error)
  - macOS: Resource exhaustion ("fork/exec: resource temporarily unavailable")
  - All platforms: Complex maintenance requirements
  
  Decision: Remove the benchmark workflow to reduce CI/CD complexity and maintenance overhead.
  Developers can still run benchmarks locally with make commands when needed.
  
tasks:
  - [x] Remove .github/workflows/benchmarks.yml
  - [x] Commit and push the removal
  - [x] Update documentation if benchmark workflow is mentioned (確認済み：言及なし)
  
acceptance_criteria:
  - Benchmark workflow is removed from the repository
  - CI/CD pipelines are simplified
  - Local benchmark execution remains functional
